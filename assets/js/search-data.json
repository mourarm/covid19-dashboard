This is an attempt to understand what&#39;s happening, and what the future looks like if current trends remain unchanged. | Everything is approximated and depends heavily on underlying assumptions. | Transmission rate calculation: Growth rate is calculated over the 5 past days by averaging the daily growth rates. | Confidence bounds are calculated from the weighted standard deviation of the growth rate over the last 5 days. Model predictions are calculated for growth rates within 1 STD of the weighted mean. The maximum and minimum values for each day are used as confidence bands. Countries with highly noisy transmission rates are exluded from tranmission rate change tables (&quot;new waves&quot;, &quot;slowing waves&quot;). | Transmission rate, and its STD are calculated from growth rate and its STD using active cases estimation. | For projections (into future) very noisy projections (with broad confidence bounds) are not shown in the tables. | Where the rate estimated from Total Outstanding Cases is too high (on down-slopes) recovery probability if 1/20 is used (equivalent 20 days to recover). | . | Total cases are estimated from the reported deaths for each country: Each country has a different testing policy and capacity and cases are under-reported in some countries. Using an estimated IFR (fatality rate) we can estimate the number of cases some time ago by using the total deaths until today. | IFRs for each country is estimated using the age adjusted IFRs from May 1 New York paper and UN demographic data for 2020. These IFRs can be found in df[&#39;age_adjusted_ifr&#39;] column. Some examples: US - 0.98%, UK - 1.1%, Qatar - 0.25%, Italy - 1.4%, Japan - 1.6%. | The average fatality lag is assumed to be 8 days on average for a case to go from being confirmed positive (after incubation + testing lag) to death. This is the same figure used by &quot;Estimating The Infected Population From Deaths&quot;. | Testing bias adjustment: the actual lagged fatality rate is than divided by the IFR to estimate the testing bias in a country. The estimated testing bias then multiplies the reported case numbers to estimate the true case numbers (=case numbers if testing coverage was as comprehensive as in the heavily tested countries). | . | ICU need is calculated and age-adjusted as follows: UK ICU ratio was reported as 4.4% of active reported cases. | Using UKs ICU ratio, UK&#39;s testing bias, and IFRs corrected for age demographics we can estimate each country&#39;s ICU ratio (the number of cases requiring ICU hospitalisation). | . | .",

Click outside the legend to highlight all states/countries. . Only entries with at least 100 confirmed cases are considered. . The top 5 entries are initially highlighted. . Africa . America . Asia-Pacific . Europe . United States of America . Explanation . The exponential growth stage of a pandemic must end sometime, either as the virus runs out of people to infect, or as societies get it under control. However, it can be difficult to tell exactly when exponential growth is ending, for several reasons: . Humans aren&#39;t wired to understand exponentials at a glance. | It can be difficult to compare regions with differing first-infection dates, testing rates, and populations. | The news tends to report individual data points, without the contextual information necessary to interpret it. | If the plot doesn&#39;t explicitly plot the rate of new cases, a change must be quite dramatic before it becomes distinguishable. | . This visualization plots the (sliding average of) daily new cases against the total cases. This has the advantage of aligning all of them onto a baseline trajectory of exponential growth, with a very clear downward plummet when a given state gets the virus under control. As explained in the caveats below, this visualization has a very specific purpose: to make it clear whether a given state has managed to exit the exponential trajectory or not. . minutephysics has an excellent video on this visualization type, How to tell if we&#39;re beating Covid-19. . Caveats . The logarithmic scales can make it seem as if states are closer together than they actually are. For example, at time of writing (April 5th) New York (the leader in US cases) and New Jersey (the runner-up) look as though it&#39;s a close race, but New York has over three times as any cases as New Jersey. | The logarithmic scale can also obscure a resurgence of infections after a significant downturn, since the trace won&#39;t move much to the right during a short period late in time. | Time is not represented by the x-axis, which is unusual for most charts made about Covid-19. This is the plot&#39;s main advantage, because it aligns states onto roughly the same trajectory regardless of population or testing rate, but it may be unexpected. | The true number of cases is unknown, so the actual slope of the log-log change plot is unknown. All countries/states are also increasing their testing rate over time, so these data may imply that the infection rate is increasing faster than it actually is. | The data these plots rely on are incomplete, and come in less smoothly than they may imply. Healthcare systems around the world collect and report data when they can. | This chart plots the logarithm of the sliding window average of the daily growth rate on the y-axis, not the raw daily growth rate, because there&#39;s too much variability day-to-day to visually detect the trend. This also makes the plot a pessimistic estimate of where each state is on its trajectory. | References .

Methodology . I&#39;m not an epidemiologist. This is an attempt to understand what&#39;s happening, and what the future looks like if current trends remain unchanged. | Everything is approximated and depends heavily on underlying assumptions. | Projection is done using a simple SIR model (see examples) combined with the approach in Total Outstanding Cases: Growth rate is calculated over the 5 past days by averaging the daily growth rates. | Confidence bounds are calculated by from the weighted standard deviation of the growth rate over the last 5 days. Model predictions are calculated for growth rates within 1 STD of the weighted mean. The maximum and minimum values for each day are used as confidence bands. | Transmission rate, and its STD are calculated from growth rate and its STD using active cases estimation mentioned above. | For projections (into future) very noisy projections (with broad confidence bounds) are not shown in the tables. | Where the rate estimated from Total Outstanding Cases is too high (on down-slopes) recovery probability if 1/20 is used (equivalent 20 days to recover). | . | Total cases are estimated from the reported deaths for each country: Each country has a different testing policy and capacity and cases are under-reported in some countries. Using an estimated IFR (fatality rate) we can estimate the number of cases some time ago by using the total deaths until today. | IFRs for each country is estimated using the age adjusted IFRs from May 1 New York paper and UN demographic data for 2020. These IFRs can be found in df[&#39;age_adjusted_ifr&#39;] column. Some examples: US - 0.98%, UK - 1.1%, Qatar - 0.25%, Italy - 1.4%, Japan - 1.6%. | The average fatality lag is assumed to be 8 days on average for a case to go from being confirmed positive (after incubation + testing lag) to death. This is the same figure used by &quot;Estimating The Infected Population From Deaths&quot;. | Testing bias adjustment: the actual lagged fatality rate is than divided by the IFR to estimate the testing bias in a country. The estimated testing bias then multiplies the reported case numbers to estimate the true case numbers (=case numbers if testing coverage was as comprehensive as in the heavily tested countries). | . | ICU need is calculated and age-adjusted as follows: UK ICU ratio was reported as 4.4% of active reported cases. | Using UKs ICU ratio, UK&#39;s testing bias, and IFRs corrected for age demographics we can estimate each country&#39;s ICU ratio (the number of cases requiring ICU hospitalisation). | Active cases for ICU estimation are taken from the SIR model. | Pre COVID-19 ICU capacities are from Wikipedia (OECD countries mostly) and CCB capacities in Asia. The current capacities are likely much higher as some countries already doubled or even quadrupled their ICU capacities. | . | .",

John Hopkin&#39;s University&#39;s (JHU) dataset initially reported recovered cases but has since discontinued this, however estimating the recovery duration and extrapolating for current cases should be possible from this original data. . For the time being (I hope to draw from other discussions of this topic), I will use an empirically derived formula from the limited data available from JHU: . $$R_{n} = R_{n-1} + (C_{n-9} - R_{n-1})*0.07$$ . Where $R_{n}$ is the total number of recovered cases on day $n$, and $C_{n}$ is the total number of confirmed cases on day $n$. . What it implies is that on a given day, of the cases which were first reported 9 days previously 7% of those cases would have either recovered or passed away. After 16 days therefore 49% of cases would have recovered or passed away and after 23 days 98% of cases would have recovered or passsed away. . This formula is only being used to predict the number of recoveries from the time that JHU&#39;s data is not available. We can compare the results of this formula to the existing data from JHU to show the level of fit. This can be seen in the following 2 graphs. . Visualizations and analysis by Adrian Turcato1 . .

United States 2020-10-24 | 8,575,177 | 9,209,446 | . Methodology . We argue that the number of infected in the past can be inferred using today&#39;s number of deaths and average fatality rate from confirmed cases in the following way: . $$I_{t-j} = frac{D_t}{{CFR}_t}$$ . where $I_t$ = number of infected, $D_t$ = number of deaths, and ${CFR}_t $ = case fatality rate = $ frac{D}{C}$. The $j$ depends on the average number of days that covid patients die after having the first symptoms. . Assumption 1: The case fatality rate is a good proxy for the fatality rate of the infected population . Then, in order to estimate the current number of infected $I_t$ we need to estimate its growth rate from $t-j$ to $t$. . $$I_t = (1+ hat{g})^j I_{t-j}$$ . Assumption 2: The growth rate of infected $ hat{g}$ is an unbiased estimate of $g$ . . For now we estimate $g$ using the average growth rate since having the first infected person. . Assumption 3: It takes on average 8 days to die after having the first symptoms. . This analysis was conducted by Joao B. Duarte.
